# TwineHacker

> To Debug(Or Cheat) Twine{SugarCube} Variables

based on extension from [this f95 thread](https://f95zone.to/threads/how-to-debug-or-cheat-twine-sugarcube-variables.6553/) 

(thanks to [@spectr3.9911](https://f95zone.to/members/spectr3.9911/#about))

compatible with Chrome and Firefox

## Installation instructions 
- **Chrome**: download repository and use *Developer Mode* then point directory
- **Firefox**: use *Firefox Developer Edition*, upload as *Temporary Extension* and point *TwineHacker.zip*
more later...

## Rewrite
Extension is completely rewritten, these are changes:
- **F12** - Extension has its own dev tools panel
- It's always open instead of being initially collapsed, so you might get scrolling
 (I hate this bug with not fully expandable panels and no possibility even to scroll)
- No keys to activate. If *TwH* has detected the game, it will show panel, otherwise empty.
- It's easy to add support to other engines (Wikifier etc)

## TODO
- support more games and game engines
- find out cheap(!) new variables detection
- fix extension death on a large amount of variables 

## Latest changes
- 01.07.2012 14:00 - hanging issues fixed (less computations, less cycles)
- 01.07.2012 23:00 - separate options page (in case if it still hangs) (so storage permissions are required)
- 02.07.2012 18:00 - black style, detection message
- 07.07.2012 00:00 - small fixes & changes, reorganized code
- 08.07.2012 00:00 - bugfix: checkbox initially not checked
